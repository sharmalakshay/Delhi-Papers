Starting from the day when news came from the near town that result of high school examination is likely to be announced that day. Kripa, the 16 year boy was nervous thinking that he would not get enough marks to satisfy the wants of his father. Mr.Ram, the father of kripa was a single businessman in the village and also a big landlord. Relation between Kripa and his father was only about to make kripa a successful businessman whom the villagers would fear from. Mr.Ram being illiterate wanted to make his son educated so that no one in the village can make a joke of him like they do of Mr.Ram. But, much strictness of Mr.Ram resulted in Kripa to think that his father did not love him. Hearing the news about examination result, Kripa got filled with anxiety; wherever he goes, finds his father’s stick before his eyes. This all was so fearful for him that he decided not to face it. He took his wallet, filled in his pocket money, and left home to an unknown destination. Never felt a journey as empty as on that day. It was a mixed feeling of independency and fear of what next. Kripa didn’t knew where his destiny is pushing him. Without caring about anything, Kripa was just keep on walking and walking side by side the railway track. Again and again he think about going different places then drop the idea knowing the fact that he can’t survive alone. He was also missing her mother he loved more than anything in world. He wanted to go back but fearing from his father. Before he could take any decision, life gave him a turn. What would be more shocking than finding a girl half dead just by the railway track. The girl was bleeding badly, her clothes were all looking of same color, red. Kripa has never seen such a horrible scene in her life. He checked for his breath and found she was alive. He forgot all his problems and anxieties and took her to the village hospital. It wasn’t a minute that Mr.Ram got news that Kripa has gone to hospital carrying a girl just about to die. He left all his important works and approached the hospital. Watching the girl’s condition he ordered the doctors to make the girl ready to be moved to city hospital. As there was no ambulance in the small village hospital, Mr.Ram himself took the girl in his car and admitted in a big hospital in city.
